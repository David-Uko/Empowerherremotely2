Uduak started Empower Her Remotely after her own transformative journey from traditional office work to building a successful remote career that gave her the freedom to travel the world while earning six figures.

With over 8 years of experience in remote work and having helped thousands of women transition to remote careers, Sarah is passionate about breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for women in the digital workspace.

Her mission is simple: prove that geography doesn't determine your potential, and every woman deserves the opportunity to build the career of her dreams from anywhere in the world.
